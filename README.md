If you wish to use my configuration follow these steps:

    1). Fork this repo (So you can later contribute, seems we are driven by the same motion ;) )
    2). Clone the Forked Repo
    3). mv ~/yourForkedRepo/.vimrc ~/
    4). type vim in your terminal
    5). inside vim, run the :PlugInstall command to install the plugins
    6). close vim (This is the most difficult and straight up impossible part)
    7). Enjoy!
